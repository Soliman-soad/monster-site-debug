          over or reloaded. Where LocalStorage storage don't expire the data and
          collect data until its has been forced to remove. Session Storage
          objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property.

          method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is
          being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
          undefined if a value was not returned .
